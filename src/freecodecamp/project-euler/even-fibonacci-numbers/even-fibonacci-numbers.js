/**
 * FreeCodeCamp Problem: Even Fibonacci Numbers
 * Category: Project Euler
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Topics: Mathematics, Loops, Arithmetic
 *
 * Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
 *
 * 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 * By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log n) - explanation
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - explanation
