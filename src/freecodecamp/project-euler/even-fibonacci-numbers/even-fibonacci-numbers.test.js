/**
 * FreeCodeCamp Problem: Even Fibonacci Numbers
 * Category: Project Euler
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Topics: Mathematics, Loops, Arithmetic
 *
 * Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
 *
 * 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 * By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: fiboEvenSum(8)
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: Even Fibonacci numbers below 8: 2. Sum = 2
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: fiboEvenSum(10)
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: Even Fibonacci numbers below 10: 2. Sum = 2
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: fiboEvenSum(34)
 * Output: 44
 * Explanation: Even Fibonacci numbers below 34: 2, 8. Sum = 10
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The parameter n will be a positive integer greater than 0.
 * - The function should return the sum of all even-valued Fibonacci numbers whose values do not exceed n.
