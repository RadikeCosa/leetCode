/**
 * FreeCodeCamp Problem: Fibonacci Sequence
 * Category: Coding Interview Prep
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Topics: Array, Math, Algorithms
 *
 * The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. When starting with 0 and 1, the first 10 numbers in the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
 *
 * Given an array containing the first two numbers of a Fibonacci sequence, and an integer representing the length of the sequence, return an array containing the sequence of the given length.
 *
 * Your function should handle sequences of any length greater than or equal to zero.
 * If the length is zero, return an empty array.
 * Note that the starting numbers are part of the sequence.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - Lineal en la longitud deseada de la secuencia
 * Space Complexity: O(n) - Proporcional al tama√±o del array resultante
