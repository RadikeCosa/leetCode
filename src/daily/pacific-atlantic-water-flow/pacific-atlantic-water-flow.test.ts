/**
 * LeetCode Problem 417: Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Topics: Array, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Matrix
 *
 * There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean
 * and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top
 * edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.
 *
 * The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an
 * m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height
 * above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).
 *
 * The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring
 * cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height
 * is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any
 * cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.
 *
 * Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci]
 * denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific
 * and Atlantic oceans.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
 * Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
 * Explanation: The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown
 * below:
 * [0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean
 *        [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
 * [1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean
 *        [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
 * [1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean
 *        [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
 * [2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean
 *        [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
 * [3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean
 *        [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
 * [3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean
 *        [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
 * [4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean
 *        [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
 * Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: heights = [[1]]
 * Output: [[0,0]]
 * Explanation: The water can flow from the only cell to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - m == heights.length
 * - n == heights[r].length
 * - 1 <= m, n <= 200
 * - 0 <= heights[r][c] <= 10^5
