# Intuition

When I first saw this problem, I recognized it as a geometry problem requiring the Pythagorean theorem. Each rectangle can be thought of as having a diagonal that forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides equal to length and width.

The key insight is that we need to:

1. Calculate the diagonal of each rectangle using √(length² + width²)
2. Find the rectangle with the longest diagonal
3. Handle ties by choosing the rectangle with maximum area

# Approach

I used a single-pass algorithm with two tracking variables:

1. **Iterate through each rectangle** using destructuring for clean code: `for (const [length, width] of dimensions)`

2. **Calculate diagonal and area** for each rectangle:

   - Diagonal: `Math.hypot(length, width)` (equivalent to √(length² + width²))
   - Area: `length * width`

3. **Update tracking variables** using priority logic:

   - If current diagonal > max diagonal: update both maxDiagonal and maxArea
   - If current diagonal == max diagonal: update maxArea only if current area is larger

4. **Return the area** of the rectangle with the longest diagonal (with area as tiebreaker)

# Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(n) - Single pass through the dimensions array
- **Space complexity**: O(1) - Only using constant extra space for tracking variables

# Code

```typescript
export function areaOfMaxDiagonal(dimensions: number[][]): number {
  let maxDiagonal = 0;
  let maxArea = 0;

  for (const [length, width] of dimensions) {
    const diagonal = Math.hypot(length, width);
    const area = length * width;

    if (diagonal > maxDiagonal) {
      maxDiagonal = diagonal;
      maxArea = area;
    } else if (diagonal === maxDiagonal) {
      maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
    }
  }

  return maxArea;
}
```

# Notes

- **Math.hypot()** is perfect for this use case - it calculates the hypotenuse efficiently and handles edge cases better than manual sqrt(a² + b²)
- **Destructuring** makes the code more readable than using array indices
- **Two-level comparison** (diagonal first, then area) elegantly handles the tiebreaker requirement
- **Edge cases** are naturally handled: single rectangle returns its area, multiple rectangles with same diagonal choose max area
