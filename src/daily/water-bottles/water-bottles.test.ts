/**
 * LeetCode Problem 1518: Water Bottles
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Topics: Math, Simulation
 *
 * There are n water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange k empty water bottles for one full water bottle.
 * The operation can be performed any number of times until you cannot exchange enough empty bottles to get a new full bottle.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
 * Output: 13
 * Explanation: You can drink 9 bottles to get 9 empty bottles. Exchange 3 empty bottles for 1 full bottle. Now you have 6 empty bottles and 1 full bottle. Drink it, now you have 7 empty bottles. Exchange 3 empty bottles for 1 full bottle. Now you have 4 empty bottles and 1 full bottle. Drink it, now you have 5 empty bottles. Exchange 3 empty bottles for 1 full bottle. Now you have 2 empty bottles and 1 full bottle. Drink it, now you have 3 empty bottles. Exchange 3 empty bottles for 1 full bottle. Now you have 0 empty bottles and 1 full bottle. Drink it, now you have 1 empty bottle. You cannot exchange anymore.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
 * Output: 19
 * Explanation: You can drink 15 bottles to get 15 empty bottles. Exchange 4 empty bottles for 1 full bottle. Now you have 12 empty bottles and 1 full bottle. Drink it, now you have 13 empty bottles. Exchange 4 empty bottles for 1 full bottle. Now you have 9 empty bottles and 1 full bottle. Drink it, now you have 10 empty bottles. Exchange 4 empty bottles for 1 full bottle. Now you have 7 empty bottles and 1 full bottle. Drink it, now you have 8 empty bottles. Exchange 4 empty bottles for 1 full bottle. Now you have 5 empty bottles and 1 full bottle. Drink it, now you have 6 empty bottles. Exchange 4 empty bottles for 1 full bottle. Now you have 3 empty bottles and 1 full bottle. Drink it, now you have 4 empty bottles. Exchange 4 empty bottles for 1 full bottle. Now you have 0 empty bottles and 1 full bottle. Drink it, now you have 1 empty bottle. You cannot exchange anymore.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= numBottles <= 100
 * - 2 <= numExchange <= 100
