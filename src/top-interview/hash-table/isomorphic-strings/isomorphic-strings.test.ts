/**
 * LeetCode Problem 205: Isomorphic Strings
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Topics: Hash Table, String
 *
 * Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
 * Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
 * All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters.
 * No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation:
 * The strings s and t can be made identical by:
 * • Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
 * • Mapping 'g' to 'd'.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation:
 * The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
 * Output: true
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * - t.length == s.length
 * - s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
