/**
 * LeetCode Problem 278: First Bad Version
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Topics: Binary Search, Interactive
 *
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.
 * Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.
 * Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions
 * after a bad version are also bad.
 *
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones
 * to be bad.
 *
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize
 * the number of calls to the API.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 5, bad = 4
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation:
 * call isBadVersion(3) -> false
 * call isBadVersion(5) -> true
 * call isBadVersion(4) -> true
 * Then 4 is the first bad version.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 1, bad = 1
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1
