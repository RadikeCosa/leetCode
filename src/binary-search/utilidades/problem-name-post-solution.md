# Intuition

Describe your first impressions of the problem and how you identified it as a binary search problem. What clues led you to this approach?

# Approach

Explain the binary search algorithm you implemented:

1. **Problem identification**: Why binary search applies here
2. **Template choice**: Which binary search template you used and why
3. **Search space**: What you're searching through
4. **Comparison logic**: How you decide which half to eliminate
5. **Termination**: When and how the search ends

Be explicit about the binary search mechanics and why this approach works.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(log n) - explain why logarithmic
- **Space complexity**: O(1) - constant extra space for pointers

# Code

```typescript
export function solutionName(params: Type[]): ReturnType {
  // Binary search implementation with descriptive variable names
}
```

# Notes

- **Edge cases handled**: Empty arrays, single elements, target not found
- **Template rationale**: Why this specific binary search template
- **Alternative approaches**: Linear search comparison (O(n) vs O(log n))
- **Binary search invariants**: What guarantees the algorithm maintains
- **Boundary conditions**: How left/right pointers are managed
