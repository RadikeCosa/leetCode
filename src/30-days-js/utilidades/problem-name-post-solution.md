# Intuition

Describe your first impressions of the problem and the high-level idea you used to solve it.

# Approach

Explain the algorithm you implemented. Be explicit about steps, data structures, and why this approach works.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1) (or specify if different)

# Code

```ts
export function solutionName(args: any): any {
  // ...implementation
}
```

# Notes

- Edge cases
- Possible optimizations
- Why alternative approaches were rejected
