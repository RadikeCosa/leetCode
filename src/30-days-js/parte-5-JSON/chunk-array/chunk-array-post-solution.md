# Intuition

When I first read this problem, I immediately thought about how to systematically traverse the array and extract chunks of the specified size. The key insight is that we need to move through the array in steps of `size` rather than one element at a time.

# Approach

The solution uses a simple for loop with a step increment of `size` to iterate through the array:

1. **Initialize**: Create an empty result array to store the chunks
2. **Iterate**: Loop through the array starting at index 0, incrementing by `size` each iteration
3. **Extract**: Use `slice(i, i + size)` to extract each chunk from the current position
4. **Collect**: Push each extracted chunk into the result array
5. **Return**: Return the collected chunks

The beauty of this approach is that `slice()` automatically handles the edge case where the last chunk might be smaller than `size` - if `i + size` exceeds the array length, `slice()` simply returns elements up to the end of the array.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(n) - We process each element exactly once. Although `slice()` creates copies, the total work across all slices is still linear in the input size.
- **Space complexity**: O(n) - We need to store all elements in the result array structure, which requires space proportional to the input size.

# Code

```typescript
type JSONValue =
  | null
  | boolean
  | number
  | string
  | JSONValue[]
  | { [key: string]: JSONValue };
type Obj = Record<string, JSONValue> | Array<JSONValue>;

export function chunk(arr: Obj[], size: number): Obj[][] {
  let result: Obj[][] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += size) {
    result.push(arr.slice(i, i + size));
  }
  return result;
}
```

# Notes

- **Edge cases handled automatically**: Empty arrays, size larger than array length, and partial final chunks are all handled naturally by the algorithm
- **Clean and readable**: The solution is straightforward and easy to understand
- **Optimal complexity**: Both time and space complexity are optimal for this problem
- **slice() advantage**: Using `slice()` eliminates the need for manual boundary checking on the last chunk
