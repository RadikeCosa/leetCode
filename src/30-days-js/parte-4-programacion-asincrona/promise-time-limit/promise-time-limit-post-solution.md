# Intuition

TODO: Describe your first impressions of the problem and the high-level idea you used to solve it.

# Approach

TODO: Explain the algorithm you implemented. Be explicit about steps, data structures, and why this approach works.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(1)
- Space complexity: O(1)

# Code

```ts
type Fn = (...params: any[]) => Promise<any>;

export function timeLimit(fn: Fn, t: number): Fn {
  // TODO: Implementation goes here
}
```
